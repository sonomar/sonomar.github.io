  <h2>Putting My Cards On The Table</h2>

This may sound like a bit of a generalization, but I believe we all want to know the answer to any question we ask as quickly as possible. When somebody asks a question, they aren't generally doing to just to hear someone talk, but to find an answer. The sooner we have the answers to our questions, the sooner we've expanded our knowledge of any given subject, and the sooner we can move on to asking other questions. Well, maybe we've been going about asking questions the wrong way. What if, instead of looking for a specific answer to a question, we were to listen to stories surrounding that question, and delve further into the way that question might make the person being asked feel. Maybe then we would find answers to questions we didn't even know to ask.

That may seem like a whole lot of philosophical musing without a point, but I actually have a good reason for it. You see, I've asked some very smart questions in my life, but I've also asked a lot of uninformed ones, and the worst of those queries were always asked to myself. When I was in high school, I had teachers and close friends that I could ask questions to on a regular basis. I also had a psychologist that could answer many of my more private questions. I also started learning about tarot cards. In the beginning, I thought that they would magically tell my future, but I quickly learned that while they weren't magical, they were incredibly useful.

Have you ever heard the phrase 'putting one's cards on the table'? Most people equate this metaphor to poker, but I've always found it infinitely more relevant to the tarot deck. As humans, we are immensely complex individuals, capable of so many thoughts and ideas that we often push the less interesting and more negative notions to the back of our minds. The amazing truth about tarot cards, or any mind-analysis-device, really, is that they are great for allowing us to ask ourselves questions and find the answers within ourselves that we didn't even know we were aware of. This is because the secret of tarot cards that most people don't realize is that every single card relates to you, explains what is happening in your life, and gives you a glimpse of what can happen in the future. The trick with tarot, as with any form of therapy, however, is to ask the right questions, in the most efficient way, but not to necessarily look for the kind of answer you think you should receive.

When I've spoken to psychologists in the past, I've found that when I've asked a question like, "Why do I get stomach aches when I get nervous?" It can take weeks of further discussion to find an answer. If I could go back in time and ask the same question in a more effective way, I would have asked something like, "Why does my anxiety lead to lower abdominal pain when most people I know get headaches?" This more specific question would have lead to me taking steps to fix my anxiety much faster because it was specific and actionable. The fact remains, however, that I didn't know enough about anxiety at the time to be specific, and there was no way that my initial question could have been so in depth. If, however, I had let my therapist speak more about my anxiety and listened without expectation of a specific answer, I probably would have found a solution to my problem much sooner. When I ask myself questions with or without the help of another person or an answer-aid like a tarot deck, I need to respect myself, be as specific as possible and listen for deeper answers in the same way.

While using a tarot deck nowadays, I ask many smaller questions that are to the point, and just as I'll get more specific answers when questioning another person in that way, I'll find the answers I seek on my own much faster as well. If I were to ask myself, for example, 'why am I sleeping less lately?', the answer would certainly be generic. My immediate answer would be, 'because you have a lot on your mind,' or 'because you use your computer until right before bed, which messes with your internal clock.' Both of these answers would be logical, and are technically correct, and while meditation and/or reading before turning in may be the solution to that problem, there could certainly be deeper answers that I am ignoring. Even asking someone else that question or using a tarot deck wouldn't give me better answers, just generic responses from that other person and vague metaphoric images on the card faces I would draw. Let's look at a more specific question now.

If I were to ask myself, a shrink, or a deck of cards the question, "Why does my leg twitch when I'm in bed a night, stopping me from being able to calm down and sleep?", I guarantee I'll get a better answer. This is because the question was more specific, and has both scientific and metaphoric meaning that can best be solved by using every answer possibility at my disposal. A doctor will probably tell me the scientific reasons for restless-leg syndrome and offer physical and medication-based solutions as answers to the question. I may answer the question myself using logic and experimentation, by seeing when any symptoms start, and trying alternative solutions to solve the problem (like a night-time jog). Finally, using an answer-aid like the internet will give me more medical advice that is most likely less accurate of an answer than a trained doctor would give. Finally, by using a metaphoric device such as tarot, I can look use unexpected imagery to look into the back of my mind and find reasons for my issue that I wouldn't have realized were otherwise there. The 'death' card in tarot is a great example of this. Many are shocked to draw this card when looking for an answer, but all it symbolizes is the complete end of something in one's life, and the start of something new. This card, analyzed properly, will allow me to think about all of the things that have ended in my life, and all of the things I'm beginning. That card, coupled with the four of cups, which represents mental stability, will make me think more on the things that have ended, and how they may have disrupted the parts of my evenings that once made me comfortable. With that information, I may find a reason for my insomnia completely unrelated to anything a doctor or the internet could possibly tell me, and may then be able to solve the problem completely on my own. 
      </p>
       <p>
Keep in mind, I'm not advocating the use of tarot cards, self-help, or seeing a psychologist. I'm making a point that all of these are excellent ways to find answers to difficult questions in life, and often the more of these one takes advantage of, and the more specific their questions are, the more likely they will find the real answers they're looking for.

Sometimes, I'll admit that you can't ask all three of the above possibilities (yourself,  a personal-aid, or someone else) every question. Sometimes a math question is best answered by a computer, while other times a coding question is best answered by an expert that has more knowledge about that subject. These straightforward questions certainly exist, and are far more prevalent than the kind I talked about above, but I find it very important to discern between the two, and consider whether the question you're asking really has a simple answer, or if there are different implications to consider.  You'll be surprised how often a well-asked question can completely change the direction your life takes.
