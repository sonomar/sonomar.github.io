  <h2>The DBC Experience</h2>
  <h4>July 29th, 2015</h4>

    <section>

      <p>
       The DBC Experience, to me, has already proved itself to be very different than I expected. One week ago, I thought I would be taking classes, learning lessons, and doing quizzes as if I were at an online university. Ihad no idea, first of all, that the program would already be so social. It was mentioned in Shereef's DBC Fireside Chat (http://vimeo.com/85001014) that there are three different types of people that generally come into the program: Those who think everyone will be smarter than they are, those who think they will be smarter than everyone else, and some who feel both scenarios will occur. I fall into the latter category, but so far, to my delight, members of my cohort are already posting online and helping each other with Week 1 assignments with really thoughtful questions and ideas. I had really thought that my cohort would be trained in various coding languages and infinitely more intelligent than me, and it is already helpful to know that we seem to be at similar starting points.

      The last important thing to discuss about my first impressions of Dev Bootcamp is  my own stress. Every time I hear that statement that 'some people are asked to leave the program,' I can't help but think, "That's going to be me, because why wouldn't it be?" The answer to that came during this first week in the program, when I realized that if you don't let yourself be alone in the learning process, you'll be less likely to miss out on what the rest of the group is learning, and less likely to lag behind the rest of the cohort. My stress about quizzes and assessments went down immensely once I realized how easy it is to communicate with my fellow Purple Martins if I have any questions or concerns about weekly assignments, or need to figure out a part of a challenge that has stumped me. While I have realized that Dev Bootcamp is much more communication-based than I ever imagined, it is already teaching me so many new ideas about coding and sharing codes that I'm having trouble believing how much I'll know before I even begin Phase 1. My notions of Dev Bootcamp may have changed, but my impression of it is still the same; it's pretty awesome so far.
