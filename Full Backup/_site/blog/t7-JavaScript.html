  <h2>Looping around ruby and JavaScript</h2>
  <h4>September 10th, 2015</h4>

    <section>

      <p>
If there's one task I perform almost as much as declaring variables in ruby and JavaScript, it's looping. Looping is another way of saying that you're doing something over and over again for a certain number of times. Just like an airplane when it's performing loops in order to write a message in the sky. Sure, the plane is spelling out different letters as it loops and loops through the clouds, but it's also pushing out a certain amount of smoke in a pattern a certain number of times until a word is spelled out.
      </p>
      <p>
So if we want to tell a plane to push out smoke in the form of a letter five times, we can use looping to do it! Ruby and JavaScript have some very similar ways to tell that plane to spell out a predefined word out of smoke, and they also have very different ways to do it. All of the different styles I'm going to talk about will accomplish the same goal, but they're all going to do it in different ways that way work better for different coded situations. What is the best way to code the plane's skywriting process in ruby and JavaScript? Let's find out!
      </p>
      <p>
To start with, we're going to need to give the plane something to write. How about "I love coding!" The goal of this process, whether you knew it or not, is to print each letter of that message with a trail of a three commas each after the letter. That way, the message will look like it was strung together by puffs of smoke!
      </p>
      <p>
The first thing we're going to need to do is take the string "I love coding!" and split it into an array with each letter as an item in the array! While you don't have to do this with ruby, it is necessary for JavaScript, so I'm going to do it for both. Luckily, the method, in a rare occurrence, is actually the same  for ruby and JavaScript! Just type a line of code in your that says:
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
      
      "I love coding!".split(")
       
       ==> ["I", " ", "l", "o", "v", "e", " ",
        "c", "o", "d", "i", "n", "g", "!"]
      
      </pre>
      <p>
 Look at that. In both ruby and JavaScript, we wound up with an array! Now that we have it, we want to do something to every single item in the array, one by one. The key word I just used in that last sentence is 'each'. Telling ruby or JavaScript to do something to each item is the same as telling it to loop something over and over, just change the item each time. So how do we change each letter, one by one? That's right, with a loop!
      </p>
       <p>
The loop common to ruby and JavaScript is the 'while' loop. Here's what a while loop that iterates over each item in the "I love coding" array in ruby:
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
      
      airplane_array = ["I", " ", "l", "o", "v", "e", " ",
       "c", "o", "d", "i", "n", "g", "!"]

      letter = 0

      while letter < airplane_array.length
        print airplane_array[letter] + ",,"
        letter += 1
      end 

      ==> I,, ,,l,,o,,v,,e,, ,,c,,o,,d,,i,,n,,g,,!,,
      
      </pre>
       <p>
Here's the same loop in JavaScript:       
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
      
      var airplaneArray = ["I", " ", "l", "o", "v", "e", " ",
       "c", "o", "d", "i", "n", "g", "!"]

      var letter = 0

      while (letter < airplaneArray.length) {
        console.log(airplaneArray[letter] + ",,");
        letter +=1
      }

      ==> I,, ,,l,,o,,v,,e,, ,,c,,o,,d,,i,,n,,g,,!,,
   
      </pre>
      <p>
They're very similar to each other. In JavaScript, variables must be called with 'var', brackets are used instead of 'end', and 'console.log()' is used instead of print, but other than that the codes are fairly alike. Both of these codes will print  the same thing to the console. Doesn't that output look like it was strung together by a plane?! Okay, so it's a stretch, but my point is not that commas look like clouds, but that the basics of looping in both ruby and JavaScript are inherently similar. Things start to look very different, however, when we jump into an enumerable with ruby, and a 'for' loop with JavaScript.       
      </p>
      <p>
In ruby, an enumerable method is used to quickly and concisely iterate over a series of items in an array or a hash or a string. A less complicated way of saying this is that an enumerable method makes easy, pretty loops that can do interesting things. Here is the most basic enumerable, the 'each' method, being used to iterate over the same array as before for the same output:       
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
      
      airplane_array = ["I", " ", "l", "o", "v", "e", " ",
       "c", "o", "d", "i", "n", "g", "!"]

      airplane_array.each {|letter| print letter + ",,"}

      ==>  I,, ,,l,,o,,v,,e,, ,,c,,o,,d,,i,,n,,g,,!,,
      
      </pre>
      <p>
In the code above, the '.each' method looks at each item in the array, one by one. Each item it looks at is represented by the variable letter, which I identified between pipes in the block connected to each (this block is between brackets).  After that variable is declared, I can do whatever I want to each letter by typing in code between the brackets. In this case I told each item in the array to add the string ",," to the end of itself, and print out the result, which is the same as before. The enumerable method is extremely easy to learn and is very convenient for iterating over items in an array without needing to declare an end point to the loop. There are even a wide variety of methods that replace '.each.' in the method that perform all sorts extra things to each item in the array. Using '.map' instead of each will put each item iterated over into a new array, while using '.max' will look through an array and return the item with the highest value. That one doesn't even need a block or a declared variable (though you can use one to find the item with the longest length, for example)!       
      </p>
      <p>
While looping in JavaScript is never quite as convenient or easy as using an enumerable method in ruby, the 'for' loop does simplify things quite a bit. Here's an example of the for loop in action. Can you guess what it's doing? Here's a hint: You've seen it before:       
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
      
      var airplaneArray = ["I", " ", "l", "o", "v", "e", " ",
       "c", "o", "d", "i", "n", "g", "!"]

      for (letter = 0;  letter < airplaneArray.length; letter += 1) {
        console.log(airplaneArray[letter] + ",,");
      }

      ==>  I,, ,,l,,o,,v,,e,, ,,c,,o,,d,,i,,n,,g,,!,,
   
      </pre>
      <p>
 As you can see, this is already much more complicated than the last ruby method we looked it. That said, the 'for' loop is an effective way to iterate over items in an array using JavaScript. Notice how this time we didn't need to declare a variable before the loop? In a 'for' loop, the variable is actually defined within the parentheses after the 'for' statement. The first item in the 'for' loop is always a declared variable, followed by a semicolon. The next part of the loop is the length of the loop. In the case above, I set the loop to continue as long as the value of letter is less than the length of airplaneArray. This is essentially another way to say 'look at every item in the array, then stop at the end.' This section is once again ended with a semicolon. The last section of the for loop tells the variable you declared what to do at the end of the loop. I told it to increase by one each time the loop wraps around, making the loop happen exactly once for each letter in the array. End that section with a closed parenthesis. So you know, you can add more variables to the first and last section in a 'for' loop, but you need to separate them with commas. (I.E. x = 0, y=10; x < 10; x+=1, y+=2). 
     </p>
      <p>
Sadly, the 'for' loop alone won't iterate over every item in the array yet. With this code entered, it will only run the loop the correct number of times, while the variable increases by one each time around. In order to make it iterate, we need to use the increasing variable in the array itself. By doing something to 'airplaneArray[letter]', we're changing the space corresponding to the variable that started at 0 each time the loop repeats. Essentially, every time the loop repeats, we're checking one item further down the array! If this is confusing you, try it yourself with different inputs and variable names. You'll get the hang of it soon enough!          
      </p>
      <p>
You can probably guess that there are no fancy ways to change up a 'for' loop. In general with JavaScript, if you want to do something really fancy to an array or object, you have to do it yourself, from scratch. In the end, building a machine from the bottom up will teach you a lot more about how it works, though, and you may even prefer the JavaScript, with its complex coding but fewer functions to memorize, versus java, which is easier to use, but has a massive vocabulary of items to utilize. Whatever you prefer, be sure to play around with both. You never know when you'll find that code that leads you to an idea for an amazing new program.
