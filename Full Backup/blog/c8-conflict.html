  <h1>Week 8, Day 2</h1>
  <h2>The Silver Knob</h2>

    <section>

      <p>
I've had many struggles in my life, and while they have rarely been physical, they have taught me that the best way to find a solution to any problem is to empathize, even when battling with yourself. When I was young, I used to fight with my parents by trying to scream at them until I had a toy taken away. It wasn't until high school that I finally realized that the person who shouts louder in an argument rarely winds up winning it. Ever since the fateful day that I won an argument with a friend by staying calm and collected and discussing my side of the argument logically, I've tried my best not to resolve my conflicts any other way. That doesn't mean that certain struggles haven't tested and sometimes broken my patience.    
      </p>
      <p>
During one semester in college, I lived in a dorm building that had a shared kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom. I was excited about having the kitchen especially, because it allowed me to plan and cook dinner for my friends. Well, that was the plan, anyway. When trying to cook in the kitchen, I had to deal with piles of dishes and clogged sinks, a dirty refrigerator and counter space taken up by various piles of non-kitchen objects. When doing my laundry, I had to constantly clean out weeks of built-up lint traps and machine filters, and when using the bathroom, well, let's just say shower flip-flops weren't germ-proof enough. It was clear that the majority of my dorm-mates didn't know how to take care of themselves or the space around them, and while I was upset about this, I decided to just work around the mess, and clean the kitchen by myself when necessary. This plan didn't last, however.
      </p>
      <p>
One day, upon waking up and looking at my dorm room door, I was surprised by a puddle of water forming under the door's frame. Upon opening the door, my legs were briefly assaulted by a torrent of water before I could shut it again. For some reason, the entire dorm's second floor was flooded. After rolling up my jeans, I decided to go out and investigate the source of the problem, only to find that the toilet in the unisex bathroom was clogged, the flusher was stuck in the active position, and water was pouring out of the toilet. Testing the flusher, I quickly found out that it was broken, and proceeded to do what somebody else should have when the clog began: I twisted the little silver knob on the floor by the toilet until the water stopped flowing.
      </p>
      <p>
Upon questioning my fellow dorm members, I quickly discovered that no one on my floor seemed to know how to shut off the water to the toilet! Without my intervention, the dorm would have continued to flood, and if this had happened while I was out at a class, that flood could have ruined everything on my dorm room floor! I was upset. No, I was truly pissed-off at the entire second floor of my dormitory. How could they be so stupid? I decided that I was done playing nice, and took somewhat drastic measures. I held a dorm meeting, harshly instructing everyone on how to use the water shut-off nozzle near the toilets, I stopped cleaning out the washer and dryer regularly (and surprise-surprise, a month later it broke), and I proceeded to throw everybody's dirty dishes that hadn't been cleaned in weeks into a trash bag and tossed said bag outside. Clearly, I was done putting up with this nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
Looking back at this conflict now, I realize that it made me feel anger with the rest of my dorm, and spite that they either hadn't learned how to clean up after themselves or just didn't care about the space around them. I also felt uncomfortable that I had, in that anger, caused my dorm to see me as the reason they were forced to clean up after themselves, making me seem like the bad guy in a situation that could have been better explained and better dealt with than through chastisement and passive aggression. In order to stop being seen as an enemy of the floor, I ended up needing to discuss the situation with the R.A. in our dorm to be more lenient on the rules, while over time talking to my dorm-mates logically (the way I should have done it in the first place) about why I was upset with them and how we could make the dorm a better place to live with only a small amount of effort from everyone together. By putting myself in their shoes and realizing how I made them feel through my reaction to this situation, I realized much more vividly why it caused so many people to lose their respect for me.
      </p>
       <p>
If I had to deal with this conflict all over again, I wouldn't even allow myself to get to the point of anger I reached when the dorm flooded. By avoiding the messy problems I clearly saw at the beginning of the semester and choosing to dodge around them, I was only preparing myself to eventually explode in ire, and there was no way to avoid that inevitability. If I had taken heed of the lessons I learned back in high school and talked to my dorm about potential messes and kitchen-use in advance, I may not have stopped the flood from happening, but I would have been far more likely to remain calm even after I found the reason for the problem. I also would have already created a rapport with the rest of the floor, and explaining how to fix the flooding toilet would have caused fewer looks of embarrassed upset in my direction.
      </p>
       <p>
Since that experience, I always try to deal with a conflict as soon as possible and confront it head-on, thinking of how the other person or people in that dispute might feel. Because of this tactic, I have found that most of the struggles in my life since that crazy semester have been solved quickly and quietly, and I always feel that those I'm arguing with respect me more in the end for it.  As I enter into the stresses of Dev Bootcamp Phase 1, I am hoping that I can hold on to these lessons, and not let my anger or stress get the better of me. If everyone else in the program operates with a similar philosophy as well (or at least something like it), I'm sure everyone will get along, or at least be able to sort out their differences rationally and respectfully.
