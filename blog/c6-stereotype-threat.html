  <h1>Week 6, Day 4</h1>
  <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h4>September 3rd, 2015</h4>

    <section>

      <p>
People often talk about being at the top of their game when successfully doing something that they love. A writer who publishes twelve books a year, a chef who successfully opened 3 new restaurants in record time, or a programmer who completes multiple projects on time will probably feel pretty confident about their work. The quality of the final product may differ depending on the person, but one thing has been historically proven: confidence and empowerment leads to better, more efficient work.    
      </p>
      <p>
Of course, not everyone feels this way (most people don't, in fact). In our lives there are a great many things that can eat away at our happiness, our self confidence, and our drive to succeed. Many of these outside stimuli are avoidable with professional assistance, and some of these harmful things are unavoidable, like the effect of moving or losing a loved one. Then there's another type of negativity in the world around us, one that can hurt quite a bit, and be a huge if not dire detriment to some; the kind that should be avoidable but is fueled and powered by misunderstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
One of the most powerful examples of this stimuli is often called "Stereotype Threat." During his September 2009 talk on Stereotype Threat (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk&t=7m40s">link</a>), Claude M. Steele made it clear that his studies have proven that everybody, regardless of race or sex, experiences Stereotype Threat every day of their lives. Women will find find a male-dominated industry intimidating because they stereotypically treat women like objects, deciding to only look for jobs that will give her a private office, away from the potential chauvinism. An African-American man will find that he will potentially be mocked and treated like less of a person because his hobby happens to be considered a black stereotype, and thus avoid those who might mock him in preference of being around those who he knows will respect him for who he is. An office will potentially expect a gay causasion man to be flamboyant as soon as he comes out of the closet, and that man may eventually feel like he needs to once again hide his sexual preference and find a new place to work away from those expectations. These are all examples of Stereotype Threat, and they all have a word in common: potential.
      </p>
      <p>
The expectations of being treated differently than everyone else can only lead to someone achieving less than their potential. Whatever capabilities we have, or intelligence we can utilize can first and foremost be undermined by our own fear of what will happen to us in a given situation. Worst of all, these aren't fears we can get over or push past, as many would suggest in response to those effected by Stereotype Threat, because too often those threats can come to pass, and there has been no evidence in recent years to the contrary. Stereotype Threat is very real, and it cannot be ignored or fought through by those effected by it. If we all treated each other like unique, intelligent human beings, it wouldn't be an issue, but sadly this is not the world we live in. Because it exists, almost everybody, even those who feel like they are succeeding in life in every way, will be in some way avoiding potentially amazing opportunities because they are afraid of how they will be perceived by those around them while trying to achieve those goals.
      </p>
      <p>
So how do we break down the existance of stereotype threat and stop it from being omnipresent in our lives? Some believe it can come from "Stereotype Lift" and SStereotype Boost." Stereotype Lift is basically using negative stereotypes from others to mitigate your own potential Stereotype Threat, while Stereotype Boost is emphasizing positive stereotypes in order to hide the negative ones from those vulnerable to Stereotype Threat. While there is plenty of precidence for these ideas being effective, they aren't actually helping rid the world of Stereotype Threat in any way. In fact, they only stand to increase the potential of the negative effects of it in the future! Look at it this way: When Stereotype Lift points out another person's negative stereotypes, it only creates greater future Stereotype for the other person. By simple transitive theory, it's only a matter of time before the person using Stereotype Lift becomes the victim of it. Similarly, stereotype boost may be creating positive stereotypes, but it is still creating stereotypes, and what is considered positive one day can easily be made into something very negative the next. The idea that a particular race is great at math, for example, could easily be turned into a negative stereotyping saying that the only thing that race knows is mathematics. As the examples above prove, using stereotypes in any way to combat Stereotype Threat will not work. That, of course, leads to the big question: What will stop it?
      </p>
       <p>
Many attempts have been made to stop Stereotype Threat, though most of them try to use stereotypes to achieve this goals, and thus have had mixed results. The best solutions seem to be those that won't change the world in a day, but may eventually make a difference. Education, for example, is a very important part of the eventual destruction of Stereotype Threat. From a young age, children should be made aware that this problem exists, and greater emphasis should be put on our similarities intead of differences. These lessons need to be retaught regularly during a person's life, both in school and in the media, and people need to exemplify those lessons in their everyday life. People need to stop using stereotypes as jokes, and we each need to stop using them as an excuse for mistakes we make.
      </p>
       <p>
Psychologists like Claude Steele will continue to study new ways to make Stereotype Threat go away quickly and on a large scale. Those experiments are still in process, but have so far only proven that Stereotype Threat is very real and exists for everybody, and that instances of it can be identified and lessened, but it won't stop anytime soon. While these attempts to understand and stop this world-wide problem will continue, it is up to each of us, individually, to decide to accept each other for who we are, and ask questions to understand how we differ from each other. Understanding how we are different is not a problem. The real issue is not asking enough questions, and using hearsay to create rumors about an entire group of people. Those rumors become stereotypes, and those stereotypes can only create fear. We're all here on this planet to learn as much as we can, so why not start with the people around us? The more we understand, the less of a chance Stereotype Threat has a chance to exist for our children's children.
