      Coding in Ruby or any programming language is all about simplicity. Well, okay, it's about creation first and foremost, but with that creation comes a definite need to simplify your code so that it is concise, easy to understand, and easy to move or adapt. Two of the most important aids towards that goal (in Ruby, at least) are arrays and hashes. By going over what an array and a hash look like, what they can do for your code, and how they're used, you will not only be able to write your code more concisely, but you'll also have a better understanding of the way Ruby works in general!  
      </p>
      <p>
      Let's start by looking at arrays. If you wanted to take a series of names and write a code for each of them (for example, a code for a list of who does and doesn't get a slice of pie), without arrays or hashes you would need to write a separate code for each person and lump that gigantic code together at the end. An array is basically a list of different criteria that can all be accessed at once, and it makes coding for a long list of numbers, names, or smaller codes much more tolerable. An array looks like this:
      </p>
      <aside class="example">
      <p>["Book", "Movie", "Game", "Dinner"] or [1,3,5,7,9]</p>
      </aside>
      <p>
      Those brackets are the considered the start and end-point of an array, and everything separated by commas within, whether they're numbers or strings (words or sentences contained within quotes) are the items within the array. The first example shows an array with four strings in it, and the second shows an array with five integers, or whole numbers in it. The array is ordered from left to right, slot by slot, and each slot has another number to signify it. For example, the first slot in the array of strings says "Book". Book is in slot 0 of the string. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention? Array slots start at 0, not 1. Following this logic, the number 1 in the integer array above is also in slot 0 while 3 is in slot 1, five is in slot 2, and etc. You can call on any of these numbers at any time using the syntax "array[x]", where array is the name of the array, and the x is the slot number you wish to look at. Say you want to know that the third slot of an array is. Once you've given an array a name, you just have to call the slot you want to know, and ask the console you're using to print it! Here's how you do that:
      </p>
      <aside class="example">
      <p>my_list = ["Book", 5, "light", 674]</p>
      <p>print my_list[2]</p>
      </aside>
      <p>
      The code on the top line here names the array on the right "my_list". The code on the second line tells your console to print the third slot of my_list. The third slot (remember, the first slot is slot 0, so this is slot 2) contains the string "light", so your console will print "light" (minus the quotes). Being able to list out items in Ruby and access them is incredibly important, because whether you want to tell an entire array of items to do one thing, or if you want to tell one line of code to go through a list of numbers, arrays allow for the simplicity of only a few lines of code in order to accomplish those goals. There are all sorts of methods you can access to play around with arrays in Ruby and make them work for you. Here are just a few of them.
      </p>
      <p>In order to create a new array type, just name your array and set it equal to a bracket full of as many items as you want! </p>
      <aside class="example">
      <p>my_new_array = [1,5,8,"people", "apes", "Demigods"]</p>
      </aside>
      <p> Now you can access that new array at any time by calling 'my_new_array'!</p>
      <p>You can also create a new blank array to populate later by using the code:</p>
      <aside class="example">
      <p>my_other_array = Array.new</p>
      </aside>
      <p>Pretty nifty, right? But what if you want to add to the array? There's a few methods you can use for this. One is called '.push', another is called '.shift' and the third is called '.pop'. Looking at the example, can you guess what they do?
      <aside class="example">
      <p>.push code:
      <p>alphabet = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]</p>
      <p>alphabet.push("e")</p>
      <p>By printing alphabet we get: ["a", "b", "c", "d","e"]</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>.shift code:</p>
      <p>numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</p>
      <p>numbers.shift
      <p>By printing numbers we get: [2,3,4,5,6]</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>.pop code:</p>
      <p>multiplied_by_two = [1,2,4,8,16,32]</p>
      <p>multiplied_by_two.pop
      <p>By printing multiplied_by_two we get: [1,2,4,8,16]</p>  
      </aside>
      <p>
        You probably already figured it out, but '.push' adds an item to the end of the array, '.shift' moves the first item in the array out of the array and returns it (mentions it without printing it), while .pop does the same to the item at the end of the array. These are just a few ways to manipulate and call on items in an array. Other methods include '.join', which connects all of the items in an array together in a variety of ways, and '.sort!', which sorts the items in the array from smallest to largest numerically or from 'a' to 'z' alphabetically (capitalized words first, then lowercase). Check out the following website if you want you to see more of these methods.

      I could talk about arrays all day, but it's time to discuss their clunky yet useful big brother, hashes. Let's say you don't just want a list of items like those you'd find in an array. If you want to create an accessable list of usernames and passwords for a library computer, for example, you don't want to have to keep track of two separate arrays, one consisting of the username, and the other consisting of the password. What if one of the arrays gets altered? It would make it very difficult to discern who's password goes to which username. This is where hashes come in handy. Here's what a hash looks like:</p>
        <aside class="example">
      <p>new_hash = { "key1" => "value1"
      <p>"key2" => "value2"</p>
      <p>"username(key3)"" => "password(value3)"</p>
      <p>"best_player_1(key4)"" => "pl#y@r(value4)"</p>
      <p>}</p>
      </aside> 
      <p>
      Basically, a hash does the same thing as an array, but allows for a list of key items (key1, key2, username etc.) that reference related values (value1, value2, password etc.). You will notice that 'value1' is connected to 'key1', just as 'password' is connected to 'username' in the above code. Just like with an array, we can access and manipulate this code, but by default an value stays connected to a key (unless you go out of your way to change it), so in the example of a library computer, this hash would keep each guest's username connected to their password. Similar to using arrays, we can create a new hash by giving it a name and setting it equal to a code like the one above, or set a name equal to Hash.new for an empty hash to add items to. Also like using arrays, we can access a key and it's value from the hash example above like this:  
      </p>
      <aside class="example">
      <p>new_hash["best_player_1(key4)"]</p>
      <p>printing the above code returns "pl#y@r(value4)"
      </aside>
      <p>
      By accessing a key from the above hash, we can view that key's value. Using this code, we can access and manipulate the key or value at the same time, while keeping the organization of the hash itself intact. Like arrays, hashes have many fun and useful methods that can help you when coding, too! '.has_key' will tell you if a key is present in the hash (useful for longer hashes), while calling .keys or .values after the name of your hash will give you a list of all of the names of those keys and values! While I mentioned these methods separately, many methods in Ruby are interchangeable, and will work with arrays, hashes, and more! Feel free to experiment with methods using the previously posted link to Ruby-doc above.
      </p> 
      <p>
      So why am I ranting and raving about arrays and hashes? If all we're doing is creating and changing lists and accessing what's inside of them, how is that so useful to coding? Well, as I mentioned at the beginning of this post, coding is all about simplicity. For another example, think of your code as a big ol' jigsaw puzzle. All of those pieces are spread around randomly, and it's going to take an awfully long time to take just one piece and look for another piece that matches. But what if we decide to start by only looking for border pieces? Metaphorically, those border pieces make up an array of pieces with flat sides, versus those that don't. Another array that comes up are pieces with green-tree-colors in them, while another are pieces with red-brick bits. And what about the brick bits with bits of chimney in them? To look at that criteria and subcriteria, we're talking about hash! The key is red brick, while the value is the fireplace! By grouping and combining pieces of the puzzle together, it is much easier to assemble the whole thing, and much faster! So if you're putting together thousands of lines of code to create a new pizza delivery app, wouldn't you prefer to do it faster and more easily? Well thank the lords of the code that arrays and hashes exist, then.
