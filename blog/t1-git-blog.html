  <h2>Version Control, git and github</h2>
  <h4>July 29th, 2015</h4>

    <section>

    Our first blog post for Dev Bootcamp is centered around git, github, and the idea of version control. So what is version control? As I see it, version control with git allows me to not only save a document, but to put that save up on a special shelf that allows me to go back to it later when I need to access it again. 'How is this different than just saving something as a different file in a specific folder?' That's a good question, and has a simple answer. "Saving-As" into a specific folder is version control, albeit a more complicated, GUI-based way to look at it. Version control with git allows the same tracking, but without needing to navigate through folders and compare the differences between old and new documents with a special Microsoft Word 'change tracker.' Using git, the version control is a part of the system from the beginning, and will keep track of changes almost automatically (you still need to tell it when to save those changes), and gives you a way to take a piece of the finished product that you like and finalize it into a branch of your main git page, which is pretty sweet. The point I'm trying to make is this: git is an excellent tool for writing and editing code, and with version control, I am much less worried about any mistakes I may make throughout my Dev Bootcamp career.

    Git is often compared to a tree, but I compare it more to a library. Each library has a book in it that has a piece of one final encyclopedia on display at the front of the library. When someone builds this library, and they start preparing to write and complete this encyclopedia, they will begin by writing a book that will eventually be incorporated into said encyclopedia. Maybe that book is the introduction, maybe it is the ending, that doesn't matter, because once it's done, the library keeps track of it. Perhaps there are 30 books that all have introductions to the same encyclopedia. Maybe some of those books have beem edited, and some haven't. That doesn't matter, because the librarian can decide which introduction to use for the final encyclopedia and switch that choice out later on if they want. Once that library is full of books, the librarian decides which of those books should combine to create the perfect final product, and puts the together to form the final encyclopedia. That encyclopedia is a fully working, compiled code, and the books are the pieces of the code. The library itself is the git repository in which that code is being written.      
      </p>
      <p>
        If git is a library, github is a city made up of libraries, and each github user is one of many librarians able to visit and often help change other libraries in that city. By using github to store one's code, they can show off that code to others, receive feedback on parts of the code, or ask for help on it when there are bugs. If other developers are allowed and feel so inclined, they can even add to that person's github repository (or 'library' in my previous metaphor). Most importantly, github allows for another very important level of user security. While working as a team in github, any code that is submitted will be on a branch of the final code (a 'book' in my metaphor), and before it is added to the final code (the 'encyclopedia', if you will) it will then be submitted to other 'librarian' coworkers as a 'pull request'. This means that another member of the coding team will have to check the code for bugs and confirm that it works before it is added permanently to the working script. I have found that github will make group coding easier for me and my Dev Bootcamp cohort in almost every way.
