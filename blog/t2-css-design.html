  <h2>Borders, Padding and Margins</h2>
  <h4>August 8th, 2015</h4>

    <section>

    <p>
    When coding a web page, setting up an html page and adding CSS, it is important to not only pay attention to the objects that you create within the webpage, but the space around those objects as well. Everything that one adds to their webpage, whether it be a paragraph of text or a picture of a dog, has a series of invisible boundaries around it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first boundary worth mentioning is the border. If you could draw a rectangle around a word or picture to box it in (see diagram 1), that rectangle is a border. Every element added to a website has a border (along with all of the other layers ill mention next), but it is usually invisible until it is programmed not to be. The great thing about being able to see the border is that we can now find the padding and margins of our object. See the space in between the border and the object (see diagram 1)? That space is the object's padding. That padding can be increased or decreased to put different amounts of space between the object and its border. Effectively, the padding will expand and contract the border without changing what is inside it, since the image is still contained within the padding.
      </p>
      <p>
      Now let's look at the margins. Margins are the invisible space surrounding the border. If we increase the margins on one side of an object, it's as if we are putting a pillow between a box and a wall (see diagram 2). The box will need to move to make space for the pillow, so it will need to be pushed away from the wall. If we make the pillow invisible (or take it away), that space between the box and the wall is the margin of the object. If we were to make the invisible pillow larger, the box would move over even more! That's what a margin does. It adjusts the position of the object in any direction by putting an invisible space between the border and whatever the object is surrounded by. The best way to access and manipulate these layers on any object is by using a CSS page to edit an html file. Make sure you have your CSS page linked to your html page, then you can start calling objects from the html page in your CSS page and manipulating those objects' boundaries! By manipulating those boundaries, you can box in groups of objects by editing borders and padding, put dotted-line borders around important sentences, and move an object around its current location using margins (see diagram 3)!
      </p>
      <p>
      Now that you know about margins, borders and padding, here is how you control those elements in your CSS code! First thing's first, make sure your CSS page is linked to your HTML page. Once you're linked up, pick an object or group of objects you want to edit. For this example, we'll use the "p"  groups in your HTML file. On the blank CSS sheet, type in what's between these quotes: "p {  }". That tells the CSS sheet that you're going to be modifying only the sections of your HTML document that are in between "p" and "/p" code.
      </p>
      <p>
      Between the { } brackets, you can access the border, margin, or padding by typing in the words "border", " margin", or "padding" with a colon on the end (i.e. border:). To the right of the colon, you will say what you want the thing you just typed in to do. While margins, padding, and borders may generally be invisible, these keywords can move them around, make them grow or shrink, and even make them visible! Let's look at the code "border: 2px solid black". After the colon connected to " border", I added three specifications separated by a space. I told the border to be 2 pixels wide, a solid line, and the color black. When I save my CSS document and look at the object I'm modifying on a website preview, I can see that the object now has a border surrounding it that has those attributes I put in (see diagram 4). 
      </p>
      <p>
      In the previously mentioned diagram, the empty space between the border and object is the padding, and the space surrounding the outside of the border is the margin. If we access that padding the same way we accessed the border (add the "padding:" statement between he {} brackets, on a different line than the previous "border:" statement), and add a size attribute (let's use 3px, so the full code is "padding: 3px"), we'll see that the same border surrounding the object on the website has grown (see diagram 5). This is because the increased padding pushed the border outwards like how a small rubber band expands as you push your hand through it. When we wrote "3px" after "padding," the 3px altered the the entire border, but by specifying "padding-top" instead of just "padding", we can alter just the top of that border (see diagram 6)! We can also use "padding-left", "padding-right" and "padding-bottom" to alter the other sides of the border in the same way, so feel free to experiment with the possibilities!
      </p>
      <p>
      The "margin:" statement between the brackets works the same way as the "padding" statement, just replace the word "padding" with "margin" (i.e. "margin-left:") for all code instances. The margins alter the space outside the border, but won't change the border or object's size so much as move it around. For example, if you use the " margin-left: 5px" statement between the brackets and check the object on your site, you will see that the object has shifted to the right 5 pixels (just like the pillow pushed the box in the example above), but will also push away surrounding objects of need be. Much like padding, you can alter the margins as a whole, or one side at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
      I hope this blog entry has helped you understand what the padding, border, and margins of an object are, what they do, and how to code them into a website using CSS. With a little finesse, all of these parts of an object can be modified to help create buttons, headers, footers, and even artwork for your website!
