  <h1>Week 7, Day 4</h1>
  <h2>My Values</h2>
  <h4>September 10th, 2015</h4>

    <section>

      <p>
This blog post is about my personal values, the times of my life I'm proud of, the times those values have been threatened, and how I've overcome those difficult moments. This particular entry is also guided, and the first section of the guide asked me to choose a set of values from a list that I felt strongly about during the happiest or proudest moments in my life. The values I chose were "Adventure", "Autonomy," "Challenge," "Courage," "Excitement," "Friendships," Helping Others,"Independence," "Integrity," "Responsibility," "Truth," and "Knowledge."        
      </p>
      <p>
I chose these words because I try to live up to these values more than any others, and I feel immense satisfaction when I feel I am upholding them. On a scale of 1 to 5 of how highly I hold these values, I would definitely give myself a 5. 
      </p>
      <p>
Why are these values important to me? Many of them seem unrelated to each other, but they all center on one idea; conquering fear so that I can embrace change and learn as much as I can as I explore the unknown. All of these values relate to that statement, but none more than "Adventure." While knowledge is the value and goal I seek to attain at the end of the day, and I do value it very highly, I feel that the word adventure describes the journey to reach that knowledge, and reflects every other value I chose. Adventure involves setting off into unfamiliar territory, taking on challenges, and finding the courage to break through my fears, because something amazing usually awaits me at the end of the journey. Take Dev Bootcamp, for example. It is a difficult, scary program at first glance that pushes you to your limit as you learn to code. Applying for the program was frightening in many ways, but the adventure of taking it on was too tempting to pass up. I would struggle, but I would also find excitement in that struggle. I would feel overwhelmed, but I would make new friends to help me through the challenges. Most of all, I would be tested, but I would have the courage to make it through this wild adventure and gain a working knowledge of these infinite building blocks that are programming languages. The best part is, once this adventure is over and I've reached the other side of the wilderness, I can find another wondrous yet terrifying challenge to take on.

When somebody asks my advice about a particular value, that advice usually revolves around pushing aside their fears, and is closely related to the idea of Autonomy. Many of us are expected to conform to the likes and dislikes of groups we identify with while we are in school, and between that conformity and the desire to be like our favorite fictional characters, we tend to create 2-dimensional versions of ourselves that our unwilling to accept that we can be anybody and do anything no matter where our life path has taken us so far. I have helped friends through depression because they cannot see this, and think they are on a dead-end path that they cannot escape. The truth is, anybody can drop whatever it is they're doing and start over if they are unhappy, it's just a matter of taking the thoughts, people, and objects that force an image on you and set it aside. Don't try to be a cheerleader if you were a goth-kid, because that's just switching out one archetype for another. Instead, if you're feeling trapped by the world, realize that you are everything you can ever want to be, and you can be anyone at any time. The point I'm making is, autonomy doesn't mean loneliness. It is something that will set you free, and a means to finding both opportunity and possibility.

Have the values I wrote about above helped me battle Stereotype Threat? The simple fact is that all of the values I hold most dear give me the courage and drive to take on anything I'm interested in. I try to see anyone around me that would judge me for who I am as an obstacle that is best left alone and ignored. When I decided to learn fluent Japanese and study in Japan, I was often treated as a foreigner or outsider and my work was judged just as much by my looks and by my skill. While this was one of many reasons I decided to stay in the U.S., I made a decision that I would no longer take the negative stereotypes held against me as anything but an opportunity to prove them wrong. Since then, I have been judged for everything from my love of video game music to my preferred style of beard to my being bisexual. Now I put myself in the shoes of the people judging me and wonder why they are judging, what they are afraid of, and how exciting it would be if they could overcome those fears. As long as I'm not physically threatened by those people, I'm happy to help them through the wilderness they're wandering in. After all, life is a series of adventures, and we should all be helping each other find more new worlds to explore.
