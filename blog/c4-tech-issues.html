  <h1>Week 4, Day 5</h1>
  <h2>Gender Diversity in the Tech Business</h2>
  <h4>August 21st, 2015</h4>

    <section>

      <p>
 I grew up with a twin sister and was raised by my mother alone during my formative years. It wasn't until I started making friends in middle-school that I realized how differently most men see women, partly thanks to the awkwardness of puberty. I quickly decided that I would ignore what others told me to be true, and that I would look at women the same way as I looked at anybody else. The rest of the world, however, did not seem to agree with me, and to this day I find myself interested in industries that should by all means be equally populated by men and women of all races, but are instead mostly chock full of Caucasian males.   
      </p>
      <p>
Gender diversity in the technology business is, and has always been, remarkably one-sided. Thanks to cultural, political, and straight-up negative stereotypes about what day-to-day work is like for women in software developments jobs, tech theory jobs, and even non-tech-related jobs that are in tech-filled industries, it seems that fewer women are interested in entering a field that needs as much diversity as possible occupying it. Can you imagine what the world would be like if everyone who wanted to learn how to be a programmer was given the opportunity (and had the courage and support)  to learn how to do so?    
      </p>
      <p>
Men and women of every race are all potentially good programmers. In the end, though, many established rules and tropes about the tech world make it look like an unfriendly place for more than 50% of those people, especially women. What seems to be the easiest, and yet is often the most difficult of these stereotypes to find a way to dispel is the cultural stereotype that women shouldn't work in tech, and that it is a man's world. It really does feel like if everyone could just accept that every person in this world should have the right to study and pursue their passions, then this wouldn't even be a debated issue. However, even today, all over the world, women are treated culturally as a lesser being that should get married, provide children, and act in a support role to their husband regardless of their true interests. While this life-style has mostly been pushed aside in the more liberal parts of the United States, much of the country still believes that women should be support figures even though this country is proven that they are just as smart and capable as anyone with a Y chromosome.  So already, a huge percent of intelligent women with incredible potential all over the world are never going to be a part of the tech industry if the society they grew up in has anything to say about it. The biggest issue with dismantling this cultural brick wall is not only that the media still pushes the tropes of the woman-as-support-figure throughout programming on almost every channel, but that the communities around these women are often stating that these beliefs should be a way of life, and to deviate from that way of life would upset the balance of the given community and create chaos. Well, the tech industry thrives on chaos. If every new program and piece of software were exactly the same, technology would never improve. If those held back by society around them aren't able to ignore the so-called 'rules' constantly shoved in their faces by television, the internet, and the people around them, then there's a huge part of the percentage of future programmers, men and women (but especially women) that will never see the light of day.        
      </p>
      <p>
So how do we fix this particular issue? Sure, we can push out advertisements and television shows that show the freedom that women are capable of having if they choose to separate themselves from their oppressive communities, but I feel that would lead to more rebellion towards repression and less creativity. Most people are raised as part of that community, and are constantly absorbing the lessons of that group's beliefs and rules. Honestly, I believe that we're not going to really show the people who grow up in these biased places that they are capable of anything until we have can solidify the fact that first and foremost, we are all people, and we should all be treated the same way. I believe that this idea can be most effectively shown through workplace equality, and considering we haven't even given men and women equal rights in the office, I'm not sure we're anywhere near proving that equality should be a fact of life for everybody.        
      </p>
      <p>
In the past, workplaces have taken loud, aggressive approaches to hiring diversely in the workplace. Giving special scholarships to a particular group of people, having a required number of diverse groups in the office, and changing holidays around to improve respect towards those groups are just a few of today's macro-ideas that can sometimes work well, but if done wrong can result in the further division of one group from another, and create animosity that was never necessary in the first place. On the smaller level, social experiments are being enacted and modified to test how to give women in the workplace more rights, especially in the tech field. By changing small wordings in everything from applications to job descriptions, many psychologists have been able to help employers close pay equality gap between men and women by over 40%. Many social scientists today call these small changes "Bias Interrupters." One example of a Bias Interrupter would be studying where the change in earnings occur between men and women. According to Hacking Tech's Diversity Problems, an article by Joan C. Williams, studies have found that these discrepancies occur most often during pay negotiations, where most women did not want to negotiate a higher salary when they were not given the option, while men often did negotiate regardless. The reasons for this once again connect back the previous paragraphs, to the cultural norms we're taught to follow.  Because of this realization, however, employers were told by social scientists to change the wording of applications to mention that salaries were negotiable. To the surprise of the employers, women who interviewed in the future discussed higher salaries almost as often as men. Through strong research as opposed to , the constraints of a reward-based system alone, women were given the opportunity to break free of their perceived social biases and join an industry feeling like equals instead of concessions.        
      </p>
       <p>
While these studies can apply to many different industries, I believe the tech industry has the potential to improve the most by using these research techniques, but not only by focusing on women when implementing then. Most tech businesses today are made up of mostly male staffs that grew up with the same cultural lessons that women did. The difference for the men is that statistically, most were raised being told they are capable of doing anything with their lives, but that they should see women as less useful and often less intelligent support figures that will cause distractions in the workplace because of their distracting looks and divergent interests. So why don't we take those tropes away, little by little, study by study? Let's find out when women in the workplace make men uncomfortable, and see if we can subtly alter the workplace atmosphere to remove that moment of discomfort. I'm not talking about making rules stricter or taking away rights, mind you. I just worked at a business where earrings were not allowed to be worn by men, and all the rule seemed to do was further separate one gender from the other. No, I think that we should be releasing rules and increasing potential comfort in office spaces. If everyone that wants to wears earrings at work, then that will no longer cause discomfort amongst those in the workplace. Keep in mind, within the tech industry, in my experience many employees spend extended amounts of time at their workplace, and their coworkers become something of a tight-knit group. The longer that group is together, the more they accept each other, and the less strange their individual discrepancies are. If that family is forced to follow strict rules to all be the same, however, a single mistake or mis-worn piece of clothing could completely destroy that status quo, especially between people of different genders.

       <p>
I'm not sure if there is any perfect solution to creating equality in the tech industry (not yet, at least, though I plan on looking into it). That said, I think that if we really research each circumstance that leads to that discomfort, then little by little we can change the way people all over the world look at each other, and work to dismantle any belief-systems that make any one potential programmer feel like they have anything less to contribute than any other. Put simply, creativity begets creativity, and alleviates fear. The less fear there is, the more acceptance and potential creativity there can be. To me, that's a very positive loop.
