    Anthony Gregorc is a Phenominologist. That doesn't sound like a real profession, and Mr. Gregorc's personality test just seemed to be another complicated personality quiz that takes the complexity that we share as human beings and simplifies it down to a two-dimensional image. I was surprised, therefore, when the quiz not only didn't lead to a label upon completion, but seemed to accurately pinpoint my thinking style. My results in the Gregorc Personal Thinking Style described me as intensely Abstract Random, and even without logic, just the words 'abstract' and 'random' describe me perfectly. Upon closer inspection of the meaning of my results, I discovered that according to the test, my ideal thinking method involves visualizing ideas best in my mind without physical stimuli, and organizing those thoughts into logic based on my own order of importance as opposed to a pre-established list.  Since beginning my education with Dev Bootcamp, I have tried to embrace these ideas to see if they help or hinder the way I study, and surprise-surprise, my brain works surprisingly similar to the results of the test. As I work through my assignments for the week, I tend to look at each section in the order that makes the most sense to me, and when solving challenges, I do my best work mentally structuring the process together as opposed to writing down each element or playing with the code physically (though doing that helps too, of course). I may not believe  that Phenominologist is a real profession, but Anthony Gregorc has certainly made me believe that I'm an Abstract Random thinker.

    Since beginning Phase-0 at Dev Bootcamp, I continue to hear the little devil in my head telling me that I'm not smart enough for the program, and won't make it to the end. Those feelings of doubt increased when I put in my notice at work this week, and decided to take on my studies with the rest of Phase-0  full-time (well, in two weeks, at least). As I pair with others to work through the various challenges of the week, sometimes I have been able to figure out the solutions to problems quickly, and sometimes my pairing partner would decipher a solution long before me. It is easy to start thinking that I'm not smart enough when this happens, and I have to remind myself that I have solved my own share of exercises, and that everybody in Phase 0 thinks differently. I tend to plan my solutions best in my head (per my thinking style), while some people I've worked with found solutions more easily, and faster than me, by writing their ideas down. I've tried using their methods, but they don't work as well for me, so I figure for now I'll stick to what works. I also need to remind myself that this program isn't based on grades and scores, but on learning as much as possible, and thankfully those same pairing partners have all been very good at reminding me of that lesson every time we've worked together.

    How can I fix these worries? I need to continue to be social and pair up as much as possible, I need to make use of my accountability groups, and I need to not be afraid to ask questions when there is something in the program that I don't understand. This week, I need ask more questions about arrays and methods, and if by Friday night I still don't comprehend those ideas, I'll need to chat with some people online to get an even better understanding about these subjects. I know that I'm going to continue to be pretty hard on myself throughout my time at Dev Bootcamp, but with support from those around me and the time to really study the program's materials, I have very little doubt that I'll be ready for Phase 1.

    All my life I've been taught based on a Fixed Mindset, meaning that if I study textbooks, pass multiple choice tests, and work on assignments the way I'm told, I'll move up in life and be successful. I always figured that I would go to Graduate School, get a PHD, and be wealthy and happy for the rest of my life. Computer work was considered a place for hobbies, and taking time to improve those hobbies could only result in lower grades, which interfered with the grand life plan I had been convinced I needed to follow. It wasn't until I went to college that I learned what a Growth Mindset is (though I didn't have a name for it until Dev Bootcamp showed me). During a particularly difficult Japanese kanji quiz, I realized that the symbols I easily got the questions based on kanji I had memorized correct, but quickly forgot them after the quiz. Questions I got wrong, however, stuck in my mind, and I realized that I wouldn't forget those symbols. But how could I succeed by doing badly on a quiz? That idea seemed antithetical to my fixed mindset on how to succeed. It was at that moment I decided to break free. I held a meeting with my Japanese professor, and explained that I needed to find a way to learn by getting incorrect answers in a way that didn't affect my grades. Thanks to thinking outside the box, my professor and I decided to test my kanji knowledge using essays. I would write full papers in Japanese, and have those papers edited, correcting them to reach a higher final grade. Through those corrections, I would learn from my mistakes and be rewarded for that learning experience.

    Dev Bootcamp is amazing because it embraces the kind of thinking that allowed me to change the way I learned and look at the process of education differently. I have already learned more in a few weeks than I have been able to teach myself in months thanks to the cooperative work and weekly syllabus system that keep the program organized yet creative. I am able to learn using my Abstract Random thought process while still being able to ask questions and change up my learning style according to the ways those around me study. Every time I pair up with someone new, I plan to try their learning style throughout the week, and see if that approach works better for me. If it does, I'll keep using it, and if not, that's alright because I'll have a whole variety of other pairing partners to learn from. After all, I am not learning at Dev Bootcamp in order to get a letter grade, I am training in order to become a better person, and by being willing to adapt my learning style as I move through Phase-0, I'll be better prepared than ever to take on the later parts of this program.
