  <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>

    <section>

      <p>
Is working with others essential to success? I am, and have always have been, an introvert. I thrive being by myself, or with just a few close friends at a time. Don't get me wrong, I love spending as much time with my wife as possible, and when I do hang out with my friends, I could often converse with them for hours. I don't need to be alone, but I prefer not to work in groups, because historically that situation has lead to me doing all the work on whatever that group project may be. That said, when I was accepted into Dev Bootcamp, the idea of pairing with others to complete tasks had me worried. Would my assignments take twice as long because I would need to explain everything I was doing to somebody else? With so much peer pairing would I even enjoy the DBC program?    
      </p>
      <p>
Luckily, the answers to these questions turned out to be no, I certainly wouldn't be doing all of the work during a peer pairing session, and yes, Dev Bootcamp has already been one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  To say this program has completely changed the way I view working with others would be an understatement, actually.  DBC uses a pairing tactic called 'Piloting and Navigating', where one of the pair takes turns as either a pilot, writing down the code and operating the console, or the navigator, who reads the exercise and tells the pilot what to code. Thanks to this system, along with a really great group of people within the DBC cohort itself, I've been able to transform group work from something I dreaded into something I look forward to every week.
      </p>
      <p>
For the most part, my pairing sessions have been a mixture of fascinating and entertaining small talk. I'm meeting new people that share my passion for coding, and we're usually discussing why we joined Dev Bootcamp, why we like to code, and what we hope to use our coding skills for. By the time my previous partners and I actually begin the challenge, we've already connected as friends, and are more than happy to take on either the pilot or navigator role. 
      </p>
      <p>
Of course I've run into a few snags with my partners so far, too. From that partner being quiet during the challenge, prompting me to ask them to voice their ideas more often, all the way to working with someone who processes and discusses their code in a completely different way than mine, forcing me to constantly ask for clarification. I see this circumstances as a challenge to myself at this point, because if I can catch on to how their quirks and how their work-ethics differ from mine quickly enough, I should eventually be able to synchronize with that style, and work together with anybody. I know this is idealistic, and I may never reach that point in my peer pairing, but I now feel that it is possible to work with anybody over time by using this piloting-navigating system strategically. Have a few of my pairing partners frustrated me or upset me? Yeah, that has happened once or twice, but by accepting that the discomfort was as much my fault as it was theirs, I'm able to put that session behind me, try to figure out why my session was uncomfortable, and challenge myself to work with that person again.
      </p>
      <p>
 I don't see these pairing sessions as one-sided, and accept that I may have been the one to make a particular session uncomfortable. I know that I tend to navigate too much, even when piloting, and sometimes interrupt people mid-sentence, and I'm working to fix those flaws. I also know I have issues that I haven't been able to identify, yet. Thanks to Dev Bootcamp's anonymous feedback system, I can see exactly what various partners identified as my skills and flaws, allowing me to improve on my social-skills and thinking-process.
      </p>
       <p>
Dev Bootcamp created guidelines for these comments, too. They ask (pun intended) that the comments be actionable, specific, and kind. Though the DBC phase-0 manual gets into specifics about each of these ideas (actionable means something that can be changed, kind is about truth, not niceness etc.), I've found that just having these three words as a guide in my feedback for others has helped both myself and the rest of my cohort leave better feedback in any situation.
      </p>
       <p>
 When I read my feedback, I always take a deep breath first to prepare myself for the specific and actionable parts. I expect my pairing partners to be honest with me, so I expect the feedback to bring up constructive criticism, and hopefully write about the ways I can improve on my coding and pairing skills in the future. Luckily, thanks to the 'kind' part of the feedback guidelines, most of my feedback has been very gentle in giving me advice while still telling me what I need to fix. Most of my criticism, as mentioned above, seems centered around my urge to speak out of turn and my need to pilot when I should be navigating and vice-versa. To my surprise, I also received feedback that I wasn't speaking up enough, and that I should talk more during my pairings. I assume this is related to my pulling back to much in response to the previous comments, but maybe I just act differently with different partners.      
      </p>
      <p>
 Below the pairing comments themselves we must also fill out a small survey on our pairing partner, and looking at my various partner's reviews of me through this survey is where I tend to let my emotions get the better of me. The first few times I received these reviews, the survey skewed positively, and I felt really good about myself and my pairing style. After a couple of particularly difficult sessions, however, I started to get worse scores. Was I really a less-than-optimal pairing partner on those occasions, or was my partner at those times just taking their frustration with the challenge out on this survey? The review above those surveys were still kind and only pointed out my usual flaws, but the survey was awful! Well, thinking logically about the survey, there are a few possible reasons for mixed scores beyond angry retaliation my total failure as a pairing partner. One possibility is that we all just see the answers in the survey differently. I tend to go straight for the most positive answers if I feel my pairing partner showed those qualities, while I'm sure others feel that they want to reserve those choices for a rare, particularly amazing pairing session. Another possibility is that the reviewer grades from the lower baseline up, so that a mediocre review is still much better to them than the lowest choice on the grade-scale.        
      </p>
      <p>
 I can't ignore the way these reviews can make me feel, but I think that's the point of the system. We're all trying to be better programmers, and better team players, and the only way we're going to succeed at that is through experience and feedback with others. If we just worked on our own through the Dev Bootcamp program we might be more efficient, learn more in the end, and create some great programs. Without being able to compare those programs with others, though, there would be no one to check on our mistakes, alert us when something could be coded more efficiently, or call us out when we treat others (including those using our code) disrespectfully. Most coding jobs out there do require working with a team, after all, and lacking social skills are not going to be enticing to fellow coders in the field, nor to potential employers.       
      </p>
      <p>
Writing the feedback for my partners while following the A.S.K. guidelines seemed like a difficult task at first, but after repeating the process again and again, I've found that I really enjoy it. Keeping my reviews anonymous while still specific is probably the most difficult part of the process, but according to the meta-feedback from others on my writing, I'm doing a good job so far. It can also be difficult to give constructive criticism to others, especially if the pairing session went well, but by reminding myself how much I appreciate those comments in feedback about me, I try to make sure to be as detailed as possible while still staying kind. Sometimes I do feel that I write way too much in my feedback (and blog posts, and challenge reflections), but I really feel that it will be nice to go back and reread all of this once the program is complete, and the more details I can give, the better I'll be able to reflect on my journey.       
      </p>
      <p>
So, back to my first question: Is working with others essential to success? In today's ever-growing technology world, which is becoming more and more team-based as programs get bigger and more complicated, I will answer that question with a resounding yes. With the Dev Bootcamp pairing challenges and feedback system, I hope to improve on my own teamwork prowess every week. Without those skills, I don't think I'd have a shot in the dark at becoming a successful code artist in the tech world.
